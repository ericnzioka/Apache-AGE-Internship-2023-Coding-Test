This directory contains four functions that calculate the Fibonacci number for a given input. The functions are:

1.direct_recursion: This function uses direct recursion to calculate the Fibonacci number.
2.tail_recursive: This function uses tail recursion to calculate the Fibonacci number.
3.dynamic_programming: This function uses dynamic programming to calculate the Fibonacci number.
4.head_recursive: This function uses head recursion to calculate the Fibonacci number.

Development Environment
The functions were developed in C and they can be compiled and run on any platform that has a C compiler.

To compile the functions, run the following command in the repository directory:

gcc -o fib fib.c


This will create an executable file named `fib`. To run the functions, run the following command:

./fib <n>

where <n> is the Fibonacci number you want to calculate. For example, to calculate the 10th Fibonacci number, you would run the following command:

./fib 10

The output of the program will be the Fibonacci number for the input you provided.
